# Bringing the future of additive manufacturing into the workshop of makers today.

> Alchemical-3D was founded for one purpose, we observed the hobby space had in its own way become stagnant, affording manufacturers the ability to keep supplying the same parts over and over with different names and minor revisions.  Our mission statement is to break this mold, bring more advanced solutions to hobbyists now, while also offering other common sense solutions (and some over-engineered) to problems the community and businesses face today all while existing in the open-source framework.

## Current Projects 

### [Core (3D Printer)](https://alchemical-3d.com/core/) 

- 3D printers are diverse and complex machines, with complex problems.  Our Core printer falls in the coreXY category of design.  This printer has been designed from the ground up to manage physical as well as thermal issues we encounter as hobbyists and print farmers.  The goal of this printer is to create a system that is not only easy to build, but affordable to build, while solving as many physical and thermal problems as possible.  We cannot say this will be the cheapest printer in your selection list, but we can say it surely will not be the most expensive.  Core will likely also be the most advanced printer you have on the list.  It is developed to include some of our own and others advanced systems, including Light-Sense, VOC filtration, thermal compensation, resonance compensation, filament width detection, and more.

### Light-Sense (Laser Triangulation) 
- (link coming soon)
- One of the long standing problems the community and industry has faced is the time required to tune and manage printers production results.  Alchemical-3D identified this issue very early in our existence as we all have.   Light-Sense is meant to address the first steps toward the holy grail of printing, pushing a button and letting the printer tune itself.  Light-Sense is well into development and already partially functional while advancing further daily.   Light-Sense's first module Rubedo was on display at MRRF this year in Goshen Indiana, and will again be on display at ERRF this year in Maryland.  One of our developers, Mike has set the foundation to change everything in our space, see the video below.  The display of this hardware at MRRF prompted BTT to give Alchemical-3D the "Big Brain Energy Award" as well!

### [Retort (Filament Dryer & Storage)](https://alchemical-3d.com/retort/)

- Second to the users day to day issues with or setting up filaments, is the age old issue of hygroscopic materials and fused depositition modeling (FDM).  The maker space we exist in has problems that must be solved.  As things are today the options are essentially overpriced dryer/storage solutions that in some cases are even fire hazards or dangerous to ones health (looking at you makers baking that ABS in your kitchen appliances) or otherwise require you to continue spending money on desiccant materials, and still do not do their job well or in a timely manor, and once they are done they provide little long term protection.  This is where Retort comes in and takes over as an affordable, scalable dryer and storage solution.

### [Pestle (Hybrid Extruder)](https://alchemical-3d.com/pestle/) 

- There is an endless battle being waged in a war of words and pictures day to day in online venues.  The sides of this battle are Direct Drive and Bowden.   What if there was a middle-ground between the two, where you can keep most of the PA and retraction values from Direct Drive, but also not sacrifice the quality and indifference the Bowden system has to issue #6; all while substantially cutting tool-head mass?  This is where Pestle comes into play.
