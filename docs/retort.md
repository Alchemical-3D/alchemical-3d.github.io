## Retort Filament Dryer

> Retort is a modular and expandable filament dryer solution capable of growing to the makers needs at first build or over time.

## Project goals

- Provide an open source DIY filament dryer solution to the community with more features than comparably priced options provide.

- Easily assembled by the maker in their own workspace using either self sourced or kit parts.


## Features

- Modularity starts at one roll of filament expanding to as many as the maker requires.  The the only limitations become power supply and address availability.  As the maker increases capacity, the linear cost of this system is also reduced from initial build cost.  

- Retort fully interfaces with Klipper firmware allowing local and remote access to the hardware via the same familiar methods available today.  This enables the maker to control the unit from anywhere; just as though they were controlling their printer with the normal interface.  The single spool version of Retort draws power from its host printer and can be installed as a side panel, or a stand-alone object next to its host.  The larger multi-spool version of Retort; will be able to interface with a host printer, or have its own host unit installed for separate control.

- Retort not only dries filament, it is capable of storing it long term without concern.  The system will actively monitor chamber moisture and temperature, then operate as required to ensure optimal printing conditions for the contents.

- The system is capable of matching chamber temps of its host printer allowing a more stable print environment for the materials of choice.

- Fully supports a wide range of filament types including all of the typical selections makers are familiar working with. 





## Key parts

- Retort like other Alchemical-3D projects is an open-source endeavor.

- The system can be built in the makers own workspace.

- Printing out of ABS, ASA or PC and better is required due to thermal requirements.

- Any Klipper based system will be supported as long as USB and power output are available.  Additional power can be added if required.



## Software

-  Klipper + Mainsail/Fluidd

-  Pre-configured Alchemical-3D bundle customizable by end-user.
