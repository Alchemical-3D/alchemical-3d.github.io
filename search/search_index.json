Alchemical-3D was founded for one purpose, we observed the hobby space had in its own way become stagnant, affording manufacturers the ability to keep supplying the same parts over and over with different names and minor revisions. Our mission statement is to break this mold, bring more advanced solutions to hobbyists now, while also offering other common sense solutions (and some over-engineered) to problems the community and businesses face today all while existing in the open-source framework. Current Projects Core (3D Printer) 3D printers are diverse and complex machines, with complex problems. Our Core printer falls in the coreXY category of design. This printer has been designed from the ground up to manage physical as well as thermal issues we encounter as hobbyists and print farmers. The goal of this printer is to create a system that is not only easy to build, but affordable to build, while solving as many physical and thermal problems as possible. We cannot say this will be the cheapest printer in your selection list, but we can say it surely will not be the most expensive. Core will likely also be the most advanced printer you have on the list. It is developed to include some of our own and others advanced systems, including Light-Sense, VOC filtration, thermal compensation, resonance compensation, filament width detection, and more. Light-Sense (Laser Triangulation) (link coming soon) One of the long standing problems the community and industry has faced is the time required to tune and manage printers production results. Alchemical-3D identified this issue very early in our existence as we all have. Light-Sense is meant to address the first steps toward the holy grail of printing, pushing a button and letting the printer tune itself. Light-Sense is well into development and already partially functional while advancing further daily. Light-Sense's first module Rubedo was on display at MRRF this year in Goshen Indiana, and will again be on display at ERRF this year in Maryland. One of our developers, Mike has set the foundation to change everything in our space, see the video below. The display of this hardware at MRRF prompted BTT to give Alchemical-3D the \"Big Brain Energy Award\" as well! Retort (Filament Dryer & Storage) Second to the users day to day issues with or setting up filaments, is the age old issue of hygroscopic materials and fused depositition modeling (FDM). The maker space we exist in has problems that must be solved. As things are today the options are essentially overpriced dryer/storage solutions that in some cases are even fire hazards or dangerous to ones health (looking at you makers baking that ABS in your kitchen appliances) or otherwise require you to continue spending money on desiccant materials, and still do not do their job well or in a timely manor, and once they are done they provide little long term protection. This is where Retort comes in and takes over as an affordable, scalable dryer and storage solution. Pestle (Hybrid Extruder) There is an endless battle being waged in a war of words and pictures day to day in online venues. The sides of this battle are Direct Drive and Bowden. What if there was a middle-ground between the two, where you can keep most of the PA and retraction values from Direct Drive, but also not sacrifice the quality and indifference the Bowden system has to issue #6; all while substantially cutting tool-head mass?

Project goals Fully Enclosed or Open Air design by builders choice. Removable and printable panels afford the builder options to customize, add, or remove features based on need and cost. Support for multiple build volumes up to ~350mm and potentially larger later. Initial printer release is focused on a 300x300x300 build volume. Support for wide range of filament types including all of the \"typical\" selections makers are used to working with, PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, etc. Advanced sensor suite options including laser triangulation, filament width detection, accelerometers and more. Printing speeds up to 300mm/s Easy first layer calibration and auto detection of print issues using integrated lasers and camera system. Features Automatic Pressure Advance tuning using our laser triangulation system. Automatic Extrusion Multiplier tuning using our laser triangulation system and Pestle extrusion system. Built in resonance tuning and compensation with accelerometers usage integrated into klipper and the physical printer design. The 9mm belts minimize undesireable stretch and noise in the system resulting in superior printing quality. Belt driven Z-axis creates a higher resolution Z plain for the maker and enables faster Z-hop maneuvers. Z-Hop can be critical to printed part quality in some cases. Easy to access to belt tension mechanisms ensure the system is at peak performance at all times. All belt tension systems are mechanically assisted, no more wedging a screw driver in and pushing while trying to tighten with a free hand. Grab a hex wrench and go. Optional, (but integrated) chamber air circulation and ventilation systems so the maker can print filament in classes such as ABS and ASA indoors. Optional, (but integrated) filament drying solution known as Retort, an advanced intelligent system with integration into Klipper for both drying and storage of filament. All motors outside heating chamber (except when using Direct Drive Config) reducing motor temperatures allowing higher current delivery. Offering this slight overhead to the motors allows the user to increase current for more torque. External electronics bay keep those sensitive electronics from overheating during operation. When electronics overheat they begin throttling. This throttling can cause prints to fail or other defects during operation. Key parts Retort like other Alchemical-3D projects is an open-source endeavor. The system can be built in the makers own workspace. Alchemical-3D toolhead system supports Goliath, Dragon and V6 hotends with more to come. NEMA 17 - 42STH48-2504AC - SPEEDY POWER or equivalent and better as standard for X/Y/Z-axis including support for larger variants. All main stepper motors are outside of heated chamber (below/rear) with X/Y-Axis motion receiving exhaust as active cooling. 24V Power Standard, 48V Optional. Additional space provided under printer for makers who desire to add 48V power supplies. 2020 frame members and gantry frame with optional bracing. 1x MGN12H rail on X-axis, 5x MGN9H rails make up Y/Z-axis. 9mm 2GT belts on X/Y/Z-axis. Heavy Duty Bearings and bolts ensure your parts stay where you want them to. Printing out of ABS or ASA is required, PC or PC-ABS are also acceptable materials. Fysetc Spider, Octopus, Manta M8P MCUs are all supported. Mains bed (with heating pad) or 24V bed by user choice, mains bed is recommended for this build due to volume and heating times.

The goal of this project is to provide an ultra lightweight but powerful extruder which rides the X gantry (or anywhere else you wish) while also being able to rotate allowing the shortest Bowden tube possible. This rotation removes the need for additional bend radii in filament path to toolhead. On top of the PTFE length savings, the filament route results in lower PA value than a traditional Bowden, while preserving retraction settings which are more in line with Direct Drive. All of these benefits combined create a system that preserves the best from both worlds. Support for wide range of filament types including all of the \"typical\" selections makers are used to working with, PLA, PETG, ABS, ASA, TPU, etc. Features Lower PA ceilings than traditional Bowden solutions (better). Lower retraction values and requirements than traditional Bowden solutions (better). Reduced weight on the toolhead allowing higher acceleration/decelleration values in relative to system capabilities at any given time. Shorter PTFE length and fewer bend radii, resulting in a cleaner less resistive feed system. The medium sized buffer in filament path created by this system compensates for issue #6 (#602) allowing cleaner prints like a normal Bowden assembly. Key parts Pestle like other Alchemical-3D projects is an open-source endeavor. The system can be built in the makers own workspace. Pestle uses a round NEMA14 (or similar) 36STH20-1004AHG. Pestle is built with a typical Bondtech BMG parts kit. Printing out of ABS or ASA is required, PC or PC-ABS are also acceptable materials. Pestle excels when used on a bedslinger, but can be used on CoreXY and similar, another version of Pestle is in development specifically for CoreXY and adds sensory functions to the extruder. Firmware Compatibility Klipper Marlin Notes: This assembly comes in relatively close conditions to a heated bed and stepper motor. We will not support issues due to using materials such as PLA to build this assembly. PLA and similar materials (PETG/PLA/PLA+/ETC) are NOT suitable to build 3D printer parts out of, please do not ask if PLA is ok, it is not. If you are going to use PETG for the build, please keep an eye on the motor mount area and consider reducing current to your motor. Steppers produce heat and PETG (while better than PLA) still has a lower TG point, it could begin melting. The maker is responsible for your own safety and equipment when building and using this system, you accept all liability when using these files and printed items from both pre and current release candidates! The concept for this extruder was inspired by the now defunct Voron Jetpack. However, we would like to extend a special thanks to the Voron team for their inspiration on this product. Please take a moment if you are not familiar with the Voron project to educate yourself on the hard work they commit to the makerspace. https://vorondesign.com/","title":"Pestle Extruder"},{"location":"pestle/#alchemical-3d-pestle-extruder","text":"A flexible Bowden system designed to fit almost anywhere, while providing rotational movement to support even shorter bowden assemblies. https://github.com/Alchemical-3D/Pestle_Rotational_Bowden","title":"Alchemical 3D - Pestle Extruder"},{"location":"pestle/#project-information","text":"This is the Pestle Rotational Bowden, part of the Mortar and Pestle ecosystem.

Project goals Provide an open source DIY filament dryer solution to the community with more features than comparably priced options provide. Easily assembled by the maker in their own workspace using either self sourced or kit parts. Features Modularity starts at one roll of filament expanding to as many as the maker requires. The the only limitations become power supply and address availability. As the maker increases capacity, the linear cost of this system is also reduced from initial build cost. Retort fully interfaces with Klipper firmware allowing local and remote access to the hardware via the same familiar methods available today. This enables the maker to control the unit from anywhere; just as though they were controlling their printer with the normal interface. The single spool version of Retort draws power from its host printer and can be installed as a side panel, or a stand-alone object next to its host. The larger multi-spool version of Retort; will be able to interface with a host printer, or have its own host unit installed for separate control. Retort not only dries filament, it is capable of storing it long term without concern. The system will actively monitor chamber moisture and temperature, then operate as required to ensure optimal printing conditions for the contents. The system is capable of matching chamber temps of its host printer allowing a more stable print environment for the materials of choice. Fully supports a wide range of filament types including all of the typical selections makers are familiar working with. Key parts Retort like other Alchemical-3D projects is an open-source endeavor.
